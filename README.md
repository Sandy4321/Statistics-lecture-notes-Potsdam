Lecture notes from a statistics course I teach at Potsdam

*Introductory Statistics*

This is a graduate level course for linguistics students at Potsdam. It introduces frequentist statistics from the ground up, without using too much mathematics.

A pdf is provided for those not willing to compile it themselves.  

*Advanced Data Analysis*

These are the .Rnw files that constitute the lecture notes, along with the LaTeX style files I used. You can extract the R code within R by doing

      	  > Stangle("filename.Rnw")

The data directory has the data (I think all of it, please let me know if not).
